"""FileProcessor - verify + import downloaded files into the library.

Two halves:
- ``verify_downloaded_file``: confirm a file exists, its tags read, and key
  descriptive fields match. Used standalone for spot-checks.
- ``process_downloaded``: the import pipeline, per-file with continue-on-failure.
  For each expected file it resolves the on-disk source in slskd's download dir,
  verifies it, writes MBID tags, computes the target via the naming template,
  atomically moves it into the library, and inserts a ``library_files`` row. A bad
  file is recorded and skipped; the rest still import.

FileProcessor never touches slskd transfers - removing completed transfer records
after import is the orchestrator's job (via the client's ``cancel``).
